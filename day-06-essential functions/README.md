## Day-06-essential functions
## What I learned

input() collects user data.

len() validates text length.

type() confirms formats.

range() controls iteration.

## The code
#  Automating customer feedback collection system
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name )
feedback = input("Enter feedback: ")
print(feedback)
print(len(feedback))
print(type(feedback))

## Real Business application  
In customer feedback automation, these functions help collect responses, check if feedback is too short or too long, and generate reports. This shows I can build tools that improve customer engagement.

## What I struggled with  
I struggled with looping inputs for multiple customers smoothly.
