## What I learned

Arithmetic operators calculate values.

Comparison operators enforce limits.

Logical operators combine conditions.

Recruiters expect precise rule enforcement.

## The code
# In retail chain, automating discount calculations
# lets take:
price = 20000
amount = 50000
discount = 20/100
customer = "premium"
finalprice = price * discount
print(finalprice)
if price > 20000:
    print("discount exceeds company policy limits")
if customer  == "premium" and amount > 50000:
    print("discount applies")

## Real Business application  
In retail automation, operators enforce discount policies. Premium customers get valid discounts, clearance items are excluded, and policy violations are flagged. This proves I can translate business rules into automation logic.

## What I struggled with  
I struggled with operator precedence in complex conditions.
