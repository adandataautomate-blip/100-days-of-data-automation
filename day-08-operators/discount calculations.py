# In retail chain, automating discount calculations
# lets take:
price = 20000
amount = 50000
discount = 20/100
customer = "premium"
finalprice = price * discount
print(finalprice)
if price > 20000:
    print("discount exceeds company policy limits")
if customer  == "premium" and amount > 50000:
    print("discount applies")
