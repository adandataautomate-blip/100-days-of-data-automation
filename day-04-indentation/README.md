## Day-04-indentation
## What I learned

Indentation defines the structure of Python code.

Misaligned blocks can cause skipped steps.

Proper indentation ensures automation runs correctly.

Recruiters value clean, readable scripts.

## The code
# In logistics company, automating robot instructions
robotactions = ["scanning the item barcode" , "logging the scan into the central database" , "moving the item to the assigned shelf" , "confirming placement with a sensor check"]
for robotactin in robotactions:
    if robotactin is False:
        print("error")
    print("My action is" , robotactin)

## Real Business application  
In warehouse automation, robots must scan, log, move, and confirm items in sequence. If indentation is wrong, a robot might skip scanning before moving items, which could cause inventory mismatches. Fixing indentation shows I can keep automation workflows reliable.

## What I struggled with  
I found it tricky to keep nested conditions aligned without losing track of the flow.
