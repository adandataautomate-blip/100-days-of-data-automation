## What I learned

If‑else enables decisions.

Conditions enforce rules.

Recruiters value logical branching.

Nested if‑else handles complexity.

## The code
# In healthcare, automating patient insurance claims
amount = int(input("Enter patient claim amount: "))
insurancestatus = "inactive"
if insurancestatus == "inactive":
    print("auto reject")
elif amount > 50000:
    print("manual review")
else:
    print("send to compliance team")

## Real Business application  
In healthcare automation, insurance claims are auto‑approved, rejected, or flagged based on conditions like claim amount and insurance status. This shows I can automate sensitive decision workflows.

## What I struggled with  
I struggled with managing multiple nested conditions clearly.
