## Day-05-print function
## What I learned
The print() function communicates results, not just debugging info.

Formatting print outputs makes automation user‑friendly.

Recruiters value scripts that produce clear, readable outputs.

Print statements can connect technical logic to business communication.

## The code
# customer support automation
ticketnum = (input("Enter ticket number: "))
customername = input("Enter your name: ")
issuetype = input("Enter issue: ")
print(f"Ticket {ticketnum} for {customername} is about {issuetype}")

## Real Business application
In customer support automation, clear print outputs help agents quickly understand ticket details. Instead of raw data, formatted messages make workflows smoother and reduce confusion. This shows recruiters I can design automation that communicates results in a way business users can trust.

## What I struggled with
I struggled with formatting the print statement so it looked professional and not messy.
