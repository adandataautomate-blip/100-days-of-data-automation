# DAy-01-SYNTAX DISCIPLINE
What I learned
Syntax discipline ensures automation scripts don’t break in production.
Even small mistakes like missing colons or parentheses can stop compliance checks.
The print() function is not just for debugging — it communicates results to business users.
Recruiters value scripts that are both technically correct and business‑readable.

## The code
#employees overtime hours are mentioned in payroll automation
employeeovertime = 10
if employeeovertime > 10:
    print("Overtime requires HR approval")
else:
    print("Overtime auto-approved")


## Real Business application
In compliance automation, expense reports must be validated before reimbursement. If syntax errors exist, the script fails and employees may get reimbursed incorrectly, causing financial risk. By enforcing syntax discipline and using print() to show clear approval messages, I can design automation that prevents fraud and keeps auditors confident. This shows recruiters I can connect technical precision with real business impact.

 ## What I struggled with
I struggled with remembering to add colons and proper indentation in the if‑else block so the script didn’t throw errors.
