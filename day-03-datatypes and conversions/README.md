## Day-03-Data types
## What I learned

Data types define how information is stored.

Wrong types cause automation errors.

Mapping business data to correct types ensures reliability.

Recruiters expect strong data discipline.

## The code
# In healthcare automating patients data
patientID = str(input("Enter patient ID:  "))
print(patientID)
age = input("Enter patient's age:  ")
print(age)
billingamount = input("Enter billing amount:  ")
print(billingamount)


## Real Business application  
In healthcare automation, patient age must be an integer, billing amounts floats, and insurance status booleans. If these are wrong, compliance checks fail. Showing I can enforce correct types proves I can handle sensitive data responsibly.

## What I struggled with  
I struggled with deciding when to use boolean flags versus strings.
